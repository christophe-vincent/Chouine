                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

LICENCE PUBLIQUE GÉNÉRALE GNU
Version 3, du 29 juin 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>

Chacun est autorisé à copier et distribuer des copies conformes de ce document de licence [NdT : il s’agit du document original en anglais], mais toute modification en est proscrite.

Préambule
La GNU General Public License est une licence libre et copyleft destinée aux logiciels et autre type de créations.

Les licences de la plupart des logiciels et autres créations utilitaires sont conçues pour ôter votre liberté de partager et modifier ces créations. Par opposition, la GNU General Public License a pour but de garantir votre liberté de partager et modifier toutes les versions d’un programme – afin d’assurer qu’il demeurera libre pour tous ses utilisateurs. Nous, la Free Software Foundation, utilisons la GNU General Public License pour la plupart de nos logiciels ; elle s’applique aussi à toute autre création divulguée de cette façon par ses auteurs. Vous pouvez également l’appliquer à vos programmes.

Lorsque nous parlons de logiciel libre, nous nous référons à la liberté, pas au prix. Nos Licences Publiques Générales sont conçues pour garantir que vous ayez la liberté de distribuer des exemplaires de logiciels libres (à titre onéreux si vous le souhaitez), que vous receviez le code source ou puissiez l’obtenir si vous le souhaitez, que vous puissiez modifier ce logiciel ou en utiliser toute partie dans de nouveaux logiciels libres, et que vous sachiez que vous avez le droit de faire tout ceci.

Pour protéger vos droits, nous avons besoin d’empêcher que d’autres vous en privent ou vous demandent d'abandonner ces droits. En conséquence, vous avez certains devoirs si vous distribuez des exemplaires du logiciel ou si vous le modifiez : devoirs de respecter la liberté des autres.

Par exemple, si vous distribuez des exemplaires d’un tel programme, que ce soit à titre gratuit ou onéreux, vous devez transférer aux destinataires les mêmes libertés que celles reçues. Vous devez vous assurer qu’eux aussi reçoivent ou peuvent recevoir le code source. Et vous devez leur montrer ces stipulations afin qu’ils connaissent leurs droits.

Les développeurs qui utilisent la GNU GPL protègent vos droits en deux étapes : (1) ils revendiquent leurs droits d’auteur sur le logiciel, et (2) vous offrent cette Licence qui vous donne la permission légale de le copier, le distribuer et/ou le modifier.

Pour la protection des développeurs et des auteurs, la GPL stipule clairement qu’aucune garantie n’accompagne ce logiciel libre. Pour le bien des utilisateurs et des auteurs, la GPL requiert que les versions modifiées soient marquées comme telles, afin que leurs problèmes ne soient pas attribués de façon erronée aux auteurs des versions précédentes.

Certains dispositifs sont conçus pour empêcher l’accès des utilisateurs aux fins d’installation ou d’exécution de versions modifiées du logiciel qu’ils contiennent, bien que le fabricant le puisse. Ceci est fondamentalement incompatible avec l’objectif de protéger la liberté des utilisateurs de modifier le logiciel. Le caractère systématique de tels abus se manifeste dans le secteur des produits destinés à l’utilisation par les particuliers, précisément le secteur où cette méthode est la plus inacceptable. Par conséquent, nous avons conçu cette version de la GPL afin de prohiber la pratique pour ces produits. Si de tels problèmes survenaient de façon significative dans d’autres domaines, nous nous tenons prêts à étendre cette restriction à ces domaines dans de futures versions de la GPL, autant qu’il sera nécessaire pour protéger la liberté des utilisateurs.

Enfin, chaque programme est constamment menacé par les brevets logiciels. Les États ne devraient pas autoriser les brevets à restreindre le développement et l’utilisation des logiciels sur des ordinateurs à usage général ; mais au sein de ceux qui l’autorisent, nous souhaitons éviter le danger particulier que les brevets appliqués à un programme libre puissent le rendre en réalité propriétaire. Pour empêcher ceci, la GPL assure que les brevets ne puissent être utilisés pour rendre le programme non-libre.

Les stipulations précises relatives à la copie, la distribution et la modification suivent.

STIPULATIONS
0. Définitions
« Cette Licence » se réfère à la version 3 de la Licence Publique Générale GNU.

« Droit d’Auteur » signifie aussi toute législation similaire à celle du droit d’auteur qui s’applique à d’autres types de créations, tels que ceux sur les topographies de semi-conducteurs.

« Le Programme » se réfère à toute création protégeable par le droit d’auteur licenciée aux termes de cette Licence. Chaque licencié est désigné par « vous ». Les « Licenciés » et les « destinataires » peuvent être des personnes physiques ou morales.

« Modifier » une création signifie copier ou adapter tout ou partie de la création d’une façon nécessitant l’autorisation du titulaire du Droit d’Auteur, en dehors de la réalisation d’une copie conforme. La création résultante est appelée une « version modifiée » de la précédente création, ou une création « basée sur » la précédente création.

Une « création régie » désigne soit le Programme non modifié, soit une création basée sur le Programme.

« Propager » une création désigne faire quoi que ce soit avec celle-ci qui, sans autorisation, vous rendrait directement ou secondairement responsable du fait de la violation d’une disposition de la loi sur le droit d’auteur applicable, à l’exception de son exécution sur un ordinateur ou de la modification d’une copie personnelle. La propagation inclut la copie, la distribution (avec ou sans modification), la mise à disposition du public et dans certains pays d’autres activités également.

« Transmettre » une création désigne tout type de propagation qui permet à d’autres parties de réaliser ou recevoir des exemplaires. La simple interaction avec un utilisateur via un réseau informatique, sans transfert d’un exemplaire, n’est pas une transmission.

Une interface utilisateur interactive affiche des « Mentions Légales Appropriées » dans la mesure où elle inclut un dispositif pratique et visible de façon proéminente qui (1) affiche une mention de droit d’auteur appropriée et (2) indique à l’utilisateur qu’il n’y a aucune garantie portant sur la création (sauf si des garanties sont accordées), que les licenciés peuvent transmettre la création sous cette Licence, et comment voir une copie de cette Licence. Si l’interface intègre une liste de commandes ou d’options utilisateur, tel qu’un menu, un élément proéminent dans la liste remplit ce critère.

1. Code source
Le « code source » d’une création désigne la forme de la création préférée pour faire des modifications sur celle-ci. Le « Code objet » désigne toute forme de la création qui n’est pas le code source.

Une « Interface Standard » désigne une interface qui est soit une norme officielle définie par un organisme de normalisation reconnu soit, dans le cas d’interfaces spécifiées pour un langage de programmation particulier, une interface largement utilisée parmi les développeurs travaillant dans ce langage.

Les « Bibliothèques Système » d’une création exécutable incluent tout ce qui, en dehors de la création dans son ensemble, (a) est compris dans la forme usuelle de distribution d’un Composant Majeur mais ne fait pas partie de ce Composant Majeur et (b) sert seulement à permettre l’utilisation de la création avec ce Composant Majeur ou à implémenter une Interface Standard pour laquelle une mise en œuvre est disponible au public sous forme de code source. Un « Composant Majeur » désigne, dans ce contexte, un composant majeur essentiel (noyau, gestionnaire de fenêtres, etc.) du système d’exploitation propre (le cas échéant) sur lequel la création exécutable fonctionne, ou un compilateur utilisé pour produire la création, ou un interpréteur de code objet utilisé pour l’exécuter.

La « Source Correspondante » d’une création sous forme de code objet désigne tout le code source nécessaire pour générer, installer et (pour une création exécutable) exécuter le code objet et modifier la création, y compris les scripts pour contrôler ces activités. Cependant, cela n’inclut pas les Bibliothèques Systèmes de la création, ni les outils d’usage général ou les programmes libres généralement disponibles qui peuvent être utilisés sans modification pour réaliser ces activités, mais ne font pas partie de cette création. Par exemple, la Source Correspondante inclut les fichiers de définition d’interfaces associés aux fichiers sources de la création, et le code source des bibliothèques partagées et des sous-programmes liés dynamiquement, dès lors que la création est spécialement conçue pour les requérir via, par exemple, des communications de données ou contrôles de flux internes entre ces sous-programmes et d’autres parties de la création.

La Source Correspondante n’a pas besoin d’inclure tout ce que les utilisateurs peuvent régénérer automatiquement à partir d’autres parties de la Source Correspondante.

La Source Correspondante pour une création sous forme de code source est cette même création.

2. Permissions de Base
Tous les droits accordés par cette Licence sont concédés pour la durée des Droits d’Auteur sur le Programme, et sont irrévocables pourvu que les conditions énoncées soient remplies. Cette Licence vous permet explicitement et de manière illimitée d’exécuter le Programme non modifié. La restitution de l’exécution d’une création régie est régie par cette Licence, seulement si cette restitution, étant donné son contenu, constitue une création régie. Cette Licence reconnaît vos droits de “fair use” ou autres droits équivalents, tels que prévus par la législation sur le droit d’auteur.

Vous pouvez créer, exécuter et propager sans condition des créations régies que vous ne transmettez pas, aussi longtemps que votre licence demeure par ailleurs en vigueur. Vous pouvez transmettre des créations régies à d’autres personnes dans le seul but de leur faire réaliser des modifications à votre usage exclusif, ou pour qu’ils vous fournissent des infrastructures vous permettant d’exécuter ces créations, pourvu que vous vous conformiez aux termes de cette Licence lors de la transmission de tout élément dont vous ne contrôlez pas le droit d’auteur. Ceux qui, dès lors, réalisent ou exécutent pour vous les créations régies doivent le faire exclusivement pour votre propre compte, sous votre direction et votre contrôle, selon des termes qui leur interdisent de réaliser, en dehors de leurs relations avec vous, toute copie de vos éléments soumis au droit d’auteur.

La transmission dans toutes autres circonstances n’est permise que selon les conditions stipulées ci-dessous. Sous-licencier n’est pas autorisé ; l’article 10 le rend inutile.

3. Protéger les droits des utilisateurs contre les lois anticontournement
Aucune création régie ne sera considérée comme faisant partie d’une mesure technique efficace aux termes de toute loi applicable mettant en œuvre les obligations prévues à l’article 11 du traité international sur le droit d’auteur adopté à l’OMPI le 20 décembre 1996, ou toutes lois similaires interdisant ou restreignant le contournement de telles mesures.

Si vous transmettez une création régie, vous renoncez à tout droit d’interdire le contournement des mesures techniques dès lors qu’un tel contournement serait effectué en exerçant des droits issus de cette Licence concernant la création régie, et vous déclarez n’avoir aucune intention de limiter le fonctionnement ou la modification de la création en opposant, à l’encontre des utilisateurs de la création, vos droits ou ceux de tiers d’interdire le contournement de mesures techniques.

4. Transmission des exemplaires conformes
Vous pouvez transmettre des exemplaires conformes du code source du Programme tel que vous le recevez, sur tout support, pourvu que vous apposiez scrupuleusement et de façon appropriée sur chaque exemplaire une notice de Droit d’Auteur appropriée ; conserviez intactes toutes les mentions établissant que cette Licence et tous les termes non permissifs ajoutés conformément à l’article 7 s’appliquent à ce code ; conserviez intactes toutes les mentions d’absence de toute garantie ; et donniez à tous les destinataires un exemplaire de cette Licence avec le Programme.

Vous pouvez percevoir un prix quelconque ou aucun prix pour chacun des exemplaires que vous transmettez, et vous pouvez proposer une assistance ou la protection d’une garantie à titre onéreux.

5. Transmission des versions sources modifiées
Vous pouvez transmettre une création basée sur le Programme, ou les modifications pour la produire à partir du Programme, sous la forme de code source selon les termes de l’article 4, dès lors que vous remplissez également toutes ces conditions :

a) La création doit comporter des mentions proéminentes indiquant que vous l’avez modifiée, et donnant une date correspondante.
b) La création doit comporter des mentions proéminentes indiquant qu’elle est publiée sous cette Licence et tous les termes ajoutés conformément à l’article 7. Cette obligation modifie l’obligation de l’article 4 de « conserver intactes toutes les mentions ».
c) Vous devez licencier la création entière, dans son ensemble, aux termes de cette Licence à toute personne qui entre en possession d’un exemplaire. Cette Licence s’appliquera en conséquence, en même temps que tous les termes additionnels de l’article 7 applicables, à la création dans son ensemble, et à tous ses éléments, indépendamment de la façon dont ils sont assemblés. Cette licence ne donne aucune autorisation de licencier la création d’une quelconque autre façon, mais elle n’invalide pas une telle autorisation si vous l’avez reçue séparément.
d) Si la création a des interfaces utilisateurs interactives, chacune doit afficher les Mentions Légales Appropriées ; cependant si le Programme a des interfaces interactives qui n’affichent pas de Mentions Légales Appropriées, votre création n’a pas besoin de leur faire afficher.
Une compilation d’une création régie avec d’autres créations séparées et indépendantes, qui ne sont pas par leur nature des extensions de la création régie, et qui ne sont pas combinées avec elle de sorte à former un programme plus large, dans ou sur un volume d’un support de stockage ou de distribution, est appelé un « agrégat » si la compilation et son droit d’auteur en résultant ne sont pas utilisés pour limiter l’accès ou les droits des utilisateurs de la compilation au-delà de ce que permettent les créations individuelles. L’inclusion d’une création régie dans un agrégat n’entraîne pas l’application de cette Licence aux autres parties de l’agrégat.

6. Transmission des Formes Non Sources
Vous pouvez transmettre une création régie sous forme de code objet suivant les termes des articles 4 et 5, à condition que vous transmettiez également la Source Correspondante lisible par une machine selon les termes de cette Licence, d’une de ces façons :

a) Transmettre le code objet au sein, ou incorporé dans, un produit physique (y compris un support de distribution physique), accompagné par la Source Correspondante reproduite sur un support physique durable habituellement utilisé pour l’échange de logiciels.
b) Transmettre le code objet au sein, ou incorporé dans, un produit physique (y compris un support de distribution physique), accompagné d’une offre écrite, valable pour au moins trois ans et valable aussi longtemps que vous fournissez des pièces de rechange ou un support client pour ce modèle de produit, afin de donner à quiconque possède le code objet soit (1) un exemplaire de la Source Correspondante pour tous les logiciels dans le produit qui sont régis par cette Licence, sur un support physique durable habituellement utilisé pour l’échange de logiciels, pour un prix n’excédant pas votre coût raisonnable de transmission matérielle de la source, soit (2) un accès afin de copier la Source Correspondante depuis un serveur réseau sans frais.
c) Transmettre des exemplaires individuels du code objet avec une copie de l’offre écrite de fournir la Source Correspondante. Cette alternative n’est permise qu’occasionnellement et de façon non commerciale, et seulement si vous avez reçu le code objet avec une telle offre, en accord avec l’article 6 alinéa b.
d) Transmettre le code objet en offrant un accès depuis un emplacement désigné (à titre gratuit ou onéreux) et offrir un accès équivalent à la Source Correspondante de la même manière via le même emplacement et sans frais supplémentaire. Vous n’avez pas besoin d’obliger les destinataires à copier la Source Correspondante avec le code objet. Si l’emplacement pour copier le code objet est un serveur réseau, la Source Correspondante peut être sur un serveur différent (administré par vous ou par un tiers) qui permet des conditions équivalentes de copie, pourvu que vous mainteniez des indications claires à proximité du code objet indiquant où trouver la Source Correspondante. Indépendamment de quel serveur héberge la Source Correspondante, vous demeurez obligé de vous assurer qu’il est disponible aussi longtemps que nécessaire pour remplir ces obligations.
e) Transmettre le code objet en utilisant une transmission pair-à-pair pourvu que vous informiez les autres pairs où le code objet et la Source Correspondante de la création sont proposés au public sans frais au terme de l’article 6 alinéa d.
Une portion séparable du code objet, dont le code source est exclu de la Source Correspondante en tant que Bibliothèque Système, n’a pas besoin d’être inclus dans la transmission de la création sous forme de code objet.

Un « Produit Utilisateur » est soit (1) un « produit de consommation », ce qui désigne tout bien personnel corporel qui est normalement utilisé à des fins personnelles, familiales ou domestiques, soit (2) toute chose conçue ou vendue pour incorporation dans un foyer. En cas de doute sur le fait de déterminer si un produit est un produit de consommation, cette qualification l’emportera. Pour un produit spécifique reçu par un utilisateur donné, « normalement utilisé » renvoie à un usage typique ou commun de cette catégorie de produits, indépendamment du statut de l’utilisateur donné ou de la façon dont l’utilisateur donné utilise effectivement, souhaite utiliser ou dont il est attendu qu’il utilise le produit. Un produit est un produit de consommation indépendamment du fait que ce produit soit substantiellement à usage commercial, industriel ou professionnel, à moins que de tels usages représentent le seul mode significatif d’utilisation du produit.

Les « Informations d’Installation » d’un Produit Utilisateur désignent toutes les méthodes, procédures, clés d’autorisation ou autres informations requises pour installer et exécuter des versions modifiées d’une création régie dans ce Produit Utilisateur à partir d’une version modifiée de sa Source Correspondante. Ces informations doivent suffire à garantir que le fonctionnement continu du code objet modifié n’est en aucun cas empêché ou entravé seulement parce qu’une modification a été effectuée.

Si vous transmettez une création sous forme de code objet conformément à cet article dans, ou avec, ou spécifiquement pour une utilisation dans, un Produit Utilisateur et si la transmission intervient comme élément d’une opération dans laquelle le droit de possession et d’utilisation du Produit Utilisateur est transféré au destinataire définitivement ou pour une durée déterminée (indépendamment de la façon dont l’opération est qualifiée), la Source Correspondante transmise en application de cet article doit être accompagnée des Informations d’Installation. Toutefois, cette obligation ne s’applique pas si ni vous ni aucun tiers ne conservez la possibilité d’installer un code objet modifié sur le Produit Utilisateur (par exemple, la création a été installée en mémoire morte).

L’obligation de fournir les Informations d’Installation n’inclut pas celle de continuer à fournir un service de support, une garantie ou des mises à jour pour une création qui a été modifiée ou installée par le destinataire, ou pour le Produit Utilisateur dans lequel elle a été modifiée ou installée. L’accès à un réseau peut être refusé lorsque la modification elle-même affecte matériellement et défavorablement le fonctionnement du réseau ou viole les règles et protocoles pour la communication au travers du réseau.

La Source Correspondante transmise, et les Informations d’Installation fournies, conformément à cet article, doivent être dans un format publiquement documenté (et dont une implémentation est disponible auprès du public sous forme de code source) et ne doivent nécessiter aucune clé ou mot de passe spécial pour la décompression, la lecture ou la copie.

7. Termes additionnels
Les « Permissions additionnelles » désignent des termes qui complètent les termes de cette Licence en stipulant des exceptions à l’une ou plusieurs de ses conditions. Les permissions additionnelles qui sont applicables à l’entier Programme doivent être traitées comme si elles étaient incluses dans cette Licence, 9dans la mesure où elles sont valides au terme de la loi applicable. Si des permissions additionnelles s’appliquent uniquement à une partie du Programme, cette partie peut être utilisée séparément selon les termes de ces permissions, mais l’entier Programme demeure soumis à cette Licence sans prise en compte des Permissions additionnelles.

Quand vous transmettez un exemplaire d’une création régie, vous pouvez à votre convenance supprimer toute permission additionnelle sur cet exemplaire, ou sur n’importe quelle partie de celui-ci. (Des permissions additionnelles peuvent être rédigées afin de requérir leur propre suppression dans certains cas lorsque vous modifiez la création.) Vous pouvez stipuler des permissions additionnelles sur une contribution, ajoutée par vos soins à une création régie, sur laquelle vous disposez des droits d’auteur ou des permissions adéquates pour ce faire.

Nonobstant toute autre clause de cette Licence, pour une contribution que vous ajoutez à une création régie, vous pouvez (si vous y êtes autorisé par les titulaires des droits d’auteur sur cette contribution) compléter les termes de cette Licence avec des termes :

a) déclinant toute garantie ou limitant la responsabilité différemment des termes des articles 15 et 16 de cette Licence ; ou
b) exigeant le maintien de mentions légales spécifiées ou de mentions d’attribution de paternité spécifiées raisonnables au sein de cette contribution ou dans les Mentions Légales Appropriées affichées par les créations la contenant ; ou
c) interdisant une indication erronée de l’origine de cette contribution, ou exigeant que les versions modifiées de cette contribution soient marquées de façon raisonnable comme étant différent de la version originale ; ou
d) limitant l’usage à des fins publicitaires des noms des concédants ou des auteurs de la contribution ; ou
e) refusant d’accorder des droits aux termes du droit des marques pour l’utilisation de noms commerciaux, marques commerciales ou marques de services ; ou
f) exigeant l’indemnisation des concédants et des auteurs de cette contribution par quiconque transmettant la contribution (ou des versions modifiées de celle-ci) avec des acceptations contractuelles de responsabilité au bénéfice du récipiendaire, pour toute responsabilité que ces acceptations contractuelles imposent directement à ces concédants et auteurs.
Tous autres termes additionnels non permissifs sont considérés comme des « restrictions supplémentaires » au sens de l’article 10. Si le Programme tel que vous l’avez reçu, ou toute partie de celui-ci, contient une mention indiquant qu’il est régi par cette Licence accompagnée d’une stipulation qui est une restriction supplémentaire, vous pouvez supprimer cette stipulation. Si un document de licence contient une restriction supplémentaire mais permet la concession subséquente ou la transmission sous cette Licence, vous pouvez ajouter à une création régie une contribution régie aux termes de ce document de licence, à condition que la restriction supplémentaire ne survive pas à une telle concession subséquente ou une telle transmission.

Si vous ajoutez des termes à une création régie en accord avec cet article, vous devez inclure, dans les fichiers sources appropriés, une déclaration des termes additionnels qui s’appliquent à ces fichiers, ou une mention indiquant où trouver les termes applicables.

Les termes additionnels, permissifs ou non permissifs, peuvent être spécifiés sous la forme d’une licence écrite séparément, ou spécifiés comme des exceptions ; les exigences ci-dessus s’appliquent dans chacun de ces cas.

8. Résiliation
Vous ne pouvez ni propager ni modifier une création régie en dehors de ce qui est expressément prévu par cette Licence. Toute autre tentative de la propager ou la modifier est nulle et mettra automatiquement un terme à vos droits issus de cette Licence (y compris toute licence de brevet accordée en application du troisième paragraphe de l’article 11).

Cependant, si vous cessez toute violation de cette Licence, alors votre licence concédée par un titulaire de droit d’auteur en particulier est réinstaurée (a) à titre provisoire à moins que et jusqu’à ce que le titulaire de droit d’auteur mette fin définitivement et explicitement à votre licence, et (b) de façon permanente si le titulaire de droit d’auteur ne vous notifie pas par un moyen raisonnable la violation dans les soixante (60) jours après la cessation.

De plus, votre licence obtenue d’un titulaire de droit d’auteur en particulier est réinstaurée de façon permanente si le titulaire vous notifie par un moyen raisonnable la violation, si c’est la première fois que vous avez reçu une notification de violation de cette Licence (pour n’importe quelle création) de la part de ce titulaire de droit d’auteur, et si vous remédiez à cette violation dans les trente (30) jours qui suivent votre réception de la notification.

La cessation de vos droits en application de cet article n’entraînera pas la résiliation des licences pour les parties qui ont reçu des exemplaires ou des droits de votre part en application de cette Licence. Si vos droits ont cessé et n’ont pas été réinstaurés de façon permanente, vous n’êtes plus autorisés à recevoir de nouvelles licences pour les mêmes éléments au titre de l’article 10.

9. Acceptation non requise pour obtenir des exemplaires
Vous n’êtes pas obligés d’accepter cette Licence pour recevoir ou exécuter un exemplaire du Programme. La propagation accessoire d’une création régie qui se produit du seul fait de l’utilisation d’une transmission pair-à-pair pour recevoir un exemplaire identique ne nécessite pas d’acceptation. Cependant, seule cette Licence vous accorde la permission de propager ou de modifier une quelconque création régie. Ces actions enfreignent le droit d’auteur si vous n’acceptez pas cette Licence. Par conséquent, en modifiant ou propageant une création régie, vous manifestez votre acceptation de cette Licence de ce faire.

10. Concession automatique de Licence aux destinataires subséquents
Chaque fois que vous transmettez une création régie, le destinataire reçoit automatiquement une licence en provenance des concédants originaires, pour exécuter, modifier et propager cette création, selon les termes de cette Licence. Vous n’êtes pas responsable d’assurer la mise en conformité par d’assurer du respect de des tiers.

Une « opération entre entités » est une opération transférant le contrôle d’une organisation, ou de l’essentiel de ses actifs, ou scindant une organisation ou fusionnant des organisations. Si la propagation d’une création régie résulte d’une opération entre entités, chaque partie à cette opération recevant un exemplaire de la création reçoit également toutes licences relatives à la création que le titulaire de droit précédent avait ou pouvait transférer aux termes du paragraphe précédent, ainsi qu’un droit de détention de la Source Correspondante de cette création du titulaire de droit précédent si le prédécesseur en dispose ou peut l’obtenir par des efforts raisonnables.

Vous ne pouvez pas imposer de restriction supplémentaire à l’exercice des droits accordés ou revendiqués au titre de cette Licence. Par exemple, vous ne pouvez pas imposer de frais de licence, redevance, ni d’autre contrepartie financière nécessaire à l’exercice des droits accordés par cette Licence ; et vous ne pouvez engager une quelconque instance judiciaire (y compris une demande connexe ou reconventionnelle dans un procès) en alléguant qu’une quelconque revendication de brevet est contrefaite par la réalisation, l’utilisation, la vente, l’offre de vente, ou l’importation du Programme ou d’une quelconque partie de celui-ci.

11. Brevets
Un « contributeur » est un titulaire de droits qui autorise par cette Licence l’utilisation du Programme ou d’une création sur laquelle le Programme est basé. La création ainsi licenciée est appelée la « version contributive » du contributeur.

Les « revendications essentielles de brevet » du contributeur sont toutes les revendications de brevets détenus ou contrôlés par le contributeur, qu’elles soient déjà acquises ou qu’elles soient acquises subséquemment, qui pourraient être enfreintes par un quelconque mode, permis par cette Licence, de réalisation, d’utilisation ou de vente de sa version contributive, mais n’incluent pas les revendications qui seraient contrefaites seulement comme conséquence d’une modification ultérieure de la version contributive. Pour les besoins de cette définition, le « contrôle » inclut le droit de concéder des sous-licences de brevets d’une manière qui soit en accord avec les obligations de cette Licence.

Chaque contributeur vous accorde une licence de brevet non exclusive, mondiale et gratuite, sur les revendications essentielles de brevet du contributeur pour réaliser, utiliser, vendre, commercialiser, importer et par ailleurs pour exécuter, modifier et propager les contenus de sa version contributive.

Dans les trois paragraphes suivants, une « licence de brevet » désigne tout accord ou engagement exprès, quelle que soit sa dénomination, de ne pas se prévaloir d’un brevet (comme une permission expresse d’exercer un brevet ou un accord de ne pas poursuivre pour violation de brevet). « Accorder » une telle licence de brevet à une partie signifie conclure un tel accord ou engagement de ne pas se prévaloir d’un brevet contre la partie.

Si vous transmettez une création régie, en sachant qu’elle repose sur une licence de brevet, et la Source Correspondante de la création n’est disponible pour personne afin de copier, gratuitement et selon les termes de cette Licence, via un serveur réseau publiquement accessible ou tout autre moyen immédiatement accessible, alors vous devez soit (1) rendre la Source Correspondante ainsi disponible, soit (2) prendre vos dispositions pour vous priver vous-même du bénéfice de la licence de brevet pour cette création spécifique, soit (3) prendre vos dispositions, d’une manière cohérente avec les obligations de cette Licence, pour étendre la licence de brevet aux destinataires subséquents. « En sachant qu’elle repose » signifie que vous avez effectivement connaissance que, en l’absence de la licence de brevet, votre transmission de la création régie dans un pays, ou l’utilisation de la création régie par votre destinataire dans ce pays, violerait un ou plusieurs brevets identifiables dans ce pays que vous avez des raisons de penser valides.

Si, conformément à ou en relation avec une transaction ou un accord individuel, vous transmettez, ou propagez en procurant une transmission, une création régie et accordez une licence de brevet à quelques-unes des parties recevant la création régie les autorisant d’utiliser, propager, modifier ou transmettre un exemplaire donné de la création régie, alors la licence de brevet que vous accordée est automatiquement étendue à tous les destinataires de la création régie et des créations basées sur celle-ci.

Une licence de brevet est « discriminatoire » si elle n’inclut pas dans son étendue, prohibe l’exercice de, ou est conditionné au non exercice d’un ou plusieurs des droits qui sont spécifiquement accordés aux termes de cette Licence. Vous ne pouvez pas transmettre une création régie si vous prenez part à un accord avec un tiers qui a pour activité la distribution de logiciels, selon lequel vous effectuez un paiement au tiers fondé sur l’étendue de votre activité de transmission de la création, et selon lequel le tiers accorde, à chacune des parties qui recevrait de vous la création régie, une licence de brevet discriminatoire (a) en relation avec les exemplaires de la création régie transmis par vous (ou les exemplaires réalisés à partir de ces exemplaires), ou (b) principalement destinée à et en relation avec des produits spécifiques ou compilations qui contiennent la création régie, à moins que vous ayez conclu cet accord, ou que la licence de brevet ait été accordée, avant le 28 mars 2007.

Aucun terme de cette Licence ne pourra être interprété comme excluant ou limitant toute licence implicite ou d’autres moyens de défense en matière de contrefaçon qui vous seraient autrement disponibles selon la loi applicable relative aux brevets.

12. Non abandon de la liberté des autres
Si des obligations vous sont imposées (que cela soit par décision de justice, convention ou autrement) qui contredisent les exigences de cette Licence, elles ne vous libèrent pas des exigences de cette Licence. Si vous ne pouvez pas transmettre une création régie de façon à satisfaire simultanément vos obligations issues de cette Licence et toutes autres obligations pertinentes, alors en conséquence vous ne pouvez pas du tout la transmettre. Par exemple, si vous vous acceptez des stipulations qui vous obligent à collecter une redevance pour la transmission subséquente auprès de ceux vers qui vous transmettez le Programme, la seule façon qui puisse vous permettre de satisfaire tant ces stipulations que cette Licence serait de vous abstenir entièrement de transmettre le Programme.

13. Utilisation avec la Licence Générale Publique Affero GNU
Nonobstant toute autre clause de cette Licence, vous avez la permission de lier ou combiner toute création régie avec une création licenciée en application de la version 3 de la GNU Affero General Public License en une seule création combinée, et de transmettre la création en résultant. Les clauses de cette Licence continueront à s’appliquer à la partie qui constitue la création régie, mais les obligations spéciales de l’article 13 de la GNU Affero General Public License concernant l’interaction au travers d’un réseau s’appliqueront à la combinaison en tant que telle.

14. Versions révisées de cette Licence
La Free Software Foundation peut publier des versions révisées et/ou nouvelles de la GNU General Public License à tout moment. Ces nouvelles versions conserveront l’esprit de la présente version, mais pourront différer dans les détails afin de répondre à de nouveaux problèmes ou préoccupations.

Chaque version reçoit un numéro de version propre. Si le Programme indique qu’il est soumis à une version particulière de la GNU General Public License « ou toute version ultérieure » (or any later version) à celle-ci, vous avez la possibilité d’appliquer les stipulations soit de cette version numérotée, soit de n’importe quelle version publiée ultérieurement par la Free Software Foundation. Si le Programme n’indique pas une version spécifique de la GNU General Public License, vous pouvez choisir n’importe laquelle des versions publiées par la Free Software Foundation.

Si le Programme précise qu’un intermédiaire peut décider des versions futures de la GNU General Public License qui pourront être utilisées, la déclaration publique d’acceptation d’une version par cet intermédiaire vous autorise de manière permanente à choisir cette version pour le Programme.

Des versions ultérieures de la Licence pourront vous donner des permissions additionnelles ou différentes. Cependant, votre choix de suivre une version ultérieure n’entraîne aucune obligation supplémentaire pour tout auteur ou titulaire de droit d’auteur.

15. Déclaration d’absence de garantie
IL N’Y A AUCUNE GARANTIE POUR LE PROGRAMME, DANS LES LIMITES PERMISES PAR LA LOI APPLICABLE. À MOINS QUE CELA NE SOIT ÉTABLI DIFFÉREMMENT PAR ÉCRIT, LES TITULAIRES DE DROITS ET/OU LES AUTRES PARTIES FOURNISSENT LE PROGRAMME « EN L’ÉTAT » SANS GARANTIE D’AUCUNE SORTE, QU’ELLE SOIT EXPRIMÉE OU TACITE, CECI COMPRENANT, DE MANIÈRE NON EXHAUSTIVE, LES GARANTIES TACITES DE COMMERCIALISATION ET D’ADÉQUATION À UN OBJECTIF PARTICULIER. VOUS ASSUMEZ LE RISQUE ENTIER CONCERNANT LA QUALITÉ ET LES PERFORMANCES DU PROGRAMME. DANS L’ÉVENTUALITÉ OÙ LE PROGRAMME S’AVÉRERAIT DÉFECTUEUX, VOUS ASSUMEZ LES COÛTS DE TOUS LES SERVICES, RÉPARATIONS OU CORRECTIONS NÉCESSAIRES.

16. Limitation de responsabilité
DANS AUCUNE CIRCONSTANCE AUTRE QUE CELLES REQUISES PAR LA LOI APPLICABLE OU CONSENTIES PAR UN ACCORD ÉCRIT, LES TITULAIRES DE DROITS, OU TOUT AUTRE PARTIE QUI MODIFIE ET/OU TRANSFÈRE LE PROGRAMME AINSI QU’AUTORISÉ PRÉCÉDEMMENT, NE PEUVENT ÊTRE TENUS POUR RESPONSABLES ENVERS VOUS POUR LES DOMMAGES, INCLUANT TOUT DOMMAGE GÉNÉRAL, SPÉCIAL, ACCIDENTEL OU INDIRECTS CONSÉCUTIFS A L’UTILISATION OU A L’INCAPACITÉ D’UTILISER LE PROGRAMME (NOTAMMENT LA PERTE DE DONNÉES OU L’INEXACTITUDE DES DONNÉES RETOURNÉES OU LES PERTES SUBIES PAR VOUS OU DES PARTIES TIERCES OU L’INCAPACITÉ DU PROGRAMME À FONCTIONNER AVEC TOUT AUTRE PROGRAMME), MÊME SI UN TEL TITULAIRE OU TOUTE AUTRE PARTIE A ÉTÉ INFORMÉE DE LA POSSIBILITÉ DE TELS DOMMAGES.

17. Interprétation des articles 15 et 16
Si la déclaration d’absence de garantie et la limitation de responsabilité fournies ci-dessus ne peuvent prendre effet dans certaines juridictions en raison de leurs termes, les cours de justice qui les examinent doivent appliquer la législation locale qui s’approche le plus d’une exclusion absolue de toute responsabilité civile liée au Programme, à moins qu’une garantie ou hypothèse de responsabilité accompagne un exemplaire du Programme en contrepartie d’un paiement.

FIN DES STIPULATIONS
